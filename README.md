# Hi *AI do you speak Python?
What are the most popular machine learning (ML) &amp; reinforcement learning (RL) libraries use for research, commercial and hobby projects? Are those Python related? In this repo you will find my presentation on the topic, as well as the raw data (questioner) &amp; links to awesome research done by Jeff Hale and others.
